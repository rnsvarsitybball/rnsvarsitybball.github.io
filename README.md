# Rothesay Netherwood School Prep-Boys Basketball
The boys’ basketball prep program for Grades 10-12 is dedicated to the overall development and growth of young student athletes getting prepared to play at the next level. Students who play basketball on the Varsity Boys’ team receive an outstanding academic experience while playing basketball in one of, if not the, most competitive leagues in North America – National Preparatory Association.

The boys’ program is a two-term sports that allows students to work on strength, conditioning, and skill development in the first term, with the NPA season starting in the second term. The long-term goal of the program is to help student-athletes develop consistent habits in order to sustain a motivated, university caliber player who is prepared for the next level both on the court and in the classroom.

The program also provides year-round, one-on-one mentoring, with training and certified coaching by a former university and professional basketball player. Students have access to strength conditioning coaching designed specifically for basketball. Students also maintain a personal portfolio to help monitor their progress toward individual academic and athletic goals.
